# image-editor
This project implements techniques detailed in the paper [Poisson image editing](https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882269) by Patrick PÃ©rez, Michel Gangnet, and Andrew Blake. </br>
Specifically, the implementation includes a discrete Poisson solver, seamless cloning by importing gradients, seamless cloning by mixing gradients, texture flattening, and local illumination changes. </br>
