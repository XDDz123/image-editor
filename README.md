# Image Editor
This project implements techniques detailed in the paper [Poisson image editing](https://doi.org/10.1145/882262.882269) by Patrick PÃ©rez, Michel Gangnet, and Andrew Blake. </br></br>
Specifically, the implementation includes:
* discrete Poisson solver
* seamless cloning by importing gradients
* seamless cloning by mixing gradients
* texture flattening
* local illumination changes.

# Libraries
* cv2 (image loading, resize)
* numpy
* scipy (linear algebra)
* matplotlib (plotting, polygon region selectors)

# Features
